| Save button toggle | Switch between click-to-save and auto-save on type |
| Capture row | Parabones, Banzai Bill, Spark Pylon, Bowser with click to toggle |
| Ability row | Long Jump, Cappy, Wall Jump with click to toggle |
| Loading Zone Notes | Collapsible zones, icon picker, text notes per zone |
| Settings | All 5 toggles + moon requirement + sync server URL |
| OBS Overlay | Browser source with live state sync, transparent background |
| Scale | Default 315×450, customizable via URL parameter |
| Persistent saves | Full state stored in browser localStorage per user |
| Live sync | Optional room-based WebSocket sync for cross-browser overlays |
| Clear | Resets all progress, keeps settings |

## Hosting the Sync Server

The static tracker files stay on GitHub Pages. The live sync server is a small Node.js/WebSocket relay that you host yourself.

### Quick start (Docker Compose)

1. Clone the repo on your VPS.
2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` if you want a port other than `3000`:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - PORT=8080
   ports:
     - "8080:8080"
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. Point your Cloudflare Tunnel (or reverse proxy) to `http://localhost:PORT`.

The server listens for WebSocket connections on `/ws`. Cloudflare handles HTTPS/WSS termination, so the origin can be plain HTTP/WS.

### Manual start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`PORT` defaults to `3000`.

## OBS Setup

1. Open the tracker at `https://firerisingraging.github.io/Online_SMO_Randomizer_Tracker/`.
2. Enter a room code or click **Generate**, then click **Connect**.
3. Copy the **OBS URL** that appears.
4. In OBS, add a **Browser Source** and paste the URL.
5. Set width **315**, height **450**.
6. The overlay background is transparent — no chroma key needed.

To make the overlay larger, change **OBS Overlay Scale** in Settings. The sync section shows the calculated width and height to paste into OBS, and the scale is synced to any already-open overlays.

## How Sync Works

- Each room is identified by a 12-character code.
- When connected, every state change is sent to the sync server and broadcast to all other clients in the same room.
- Multiple controllers can share one room. Last write wins.
- Without a room code, the tracker works fully offline using `localStorage`.
- Room codes are not authenticated. Use random/generated codes and keep them private.

## How State Saves Work

Each visitor's progress is saved privately in their own browser's `localStorage` under the key `tracker_state`. Connecting to a sync room does not replace local storage; it merges remote state into the local copy.
